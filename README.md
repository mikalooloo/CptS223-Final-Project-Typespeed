CPTS223 Final Project

A C++ and SFML game named Typespeed, where words are flown across the screen and they must be typed before they reach the end.

I helped implement a hash table and implemented:
- a Button class, a Settings class
- the gameplay; displaying words moving across the screen
- a lives system
- different game modes (Easy, Normal, Hard)
- different directions for the words to come from (up, down, left, right, and all)
- sound effects and music
- toggable sound effects and music, game mode selection, and direction selection, implementing with the Settings class
